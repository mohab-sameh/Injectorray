Repository for Injectorray. The auto ASCII art into hardcoded C++ array code converter.

This C++ code receives user text input (mainly optimized for ASCII art) and turns it into a plain text C++ code which can 
later be copied and pasted into the compiler in order to inject the ASCII art directly into a 2d array, character by character.

How to use:
1) create a new C++ project file.
2) paste main code into project cpp file.
3) change the dimr and dimc variables based on the chosen ASCII art width and height.
4) change the expected indent/character position (you might play around this once or twice to get the hang of it)..
5) run program and paste the desired ASCII art you copied beforehand.
6) wait for the output then highlight it and copy it.
7) paste the previously copied output into the desired project and your ASCII art will be inserted into a 2D array.
8) tell your university professor that you've manually entered a 300x300 flying dragon ASCII art and you demand an A+ in the course.
Enjoy.
