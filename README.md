Repository for Injectorray. The auto ASCII art into hardcode C++ code converter.

This C++ code receives user text input (mainly optimized for ASCII art) and turns it into a plain text C++ code which can 
later be copied and pasted into the compiler in order to inject the ASCII art directly into a 2d array, character by character.

How to use:
1) create a new C++ project file.
2) paste main code into project cp file.
3) change the accepted ASCII art width and height using in the dimr & dimc variables.
4) change the expected indent/character position (you might play around this once or twice to get the hang of it)..
5) run program and enter paste the ASCII art.
6) wait for the output then highlight it and copy it.
7) paste the previously copied output into the desired project and what your ASCII art being magically inserted into a 2D array.
